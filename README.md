# ðŸš€ Dynamic Programming (DP) in C++ â€” Recursion, Memoization, Tabulation & Space Optimization

This repository contains a structured collection of **Dynamic Programming** problems solved in **C++**, using all major DP techniques:

- âœ… **Recursion (Brute Force)**
- âœ… **Memoization (Top-Down DP)**
- âœ… **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)**
- âœ… **Space Optimization** (where applicable)

The goal of this repo is to help learners understand **how a brute force recursion evolves into memoization and then tabulation**, along with optimizing space wherever possible.
